## Introduction and Use Case

The City of El Paso's Capital Improvements Department is seeking to understand how alterations to bus transit routes prioritize ridership, access, and equity. Our goal is to create a model that forecasts how proposed bus transit route designs achieve these criteria. Our model will be visualized in a web developed application that planners for the city of El Paso can use to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate alternative scenarios.

The use case for our app and forecast is for SunMetro planners.
