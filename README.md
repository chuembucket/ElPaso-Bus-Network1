## Introduction and Use Case

The City of El Paso's Capital Improvements Department is seeking to understand how alterations to bus transit routes prioritize ridership, access, and equity. Our goal is to create a model that forecasts how proposed bus transit route designs achieve these criteria. Our model will be visualized in a web developed application that planners for the city of El Paso can use to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate alternative bus transit scenarios.

A business as usual approach toward bus transit planning in El Paso follows trends seen throughout the U.S. in transit planning; maximizing return on investment often drives inequitable ridership trends. El Paso's current complexities with bus transit planning are current route planning is based on total ridership, with a lack of metrics to aim for; and finding ways to plan efficient transit given land use patterns of the city. 

The use case for our app and forecast is for SunMetro planners. We imagine that planners will be able to select one of the proposed bus routes in our app, and evaluate each individual metric to see how well the route performs.
